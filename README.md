## About

This was originally finished on 05/09/2015 for my high school Computer Science 2 class.

It was made with GameMaker: Studio and was intended to be used as a mobile app.

I have published it as a HTML5 project instead so my friends and I can play around with it and reminisce about the fun times we had in Mr. C's computer science class.
